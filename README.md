Write a java console application that allows the user to read, validate, store, display, sort and search data (name, age, taxable income, tax, tax group) for N taxpayers. N should be declared as a constant and it should be equal to the largest digit of your student id number (e.g. if your ID number is S1267222 then N should be equal to 7 and you can declare it as final int N=7;). The name, age and taxable income must be read from the keyboard and tax and tax group must be calculated using Table 1.

Your application should display and execute a menu with the following options. A switch statement must be used to execute the following menu options.
1.	Read, validate and store data for N taxpayers
2.	Calculate and store tax and tax group for all taxpayers
3.	Display all taxpayers
4.	Display the name and age of all taxpayers from tax group 1
5.	Search a taxpayer by age
6.	Sort and display taxpayers
7.	Exit from the application
